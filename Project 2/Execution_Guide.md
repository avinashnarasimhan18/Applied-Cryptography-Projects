### How to run the code:
In order to run the code you need to install the `concrete-ml` python library.
This library only works with python versions between 3.8 and 3.10.

After making sure your python version is compatible you can install the library with:
`pip install concrete-ml`

Finally, to run this script you can run the command:
`python main.py`

This will create the emulated machines under the directories:
`./client` for the Client Emulated Machine
`./dev` for the Development Emulated Machine
`./server` for the Server Emulated Machine

Finally to watch the video where all of the code is explained and the methodology
is presented follow this link:
